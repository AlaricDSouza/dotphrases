Research Questions
###

Questions for cellulitis without abscess that required inpatient hospital admission. Would also be interested in data on individuals treated and sent home from the ED and on the specific admission criteria.

What are good clinical correlates of outcome and how do these correlates evolve over the natural progression of the disease and treatment?
- Distribution
- Location
- Pain
- Heat at site
- Organism

What scoring mechanisms have been used to stage cellulitis and treatment?

What is the minimum treatment duration described in the literature. Is there any proven lower bound?

Does adult literature correlate well with pediatrics literature?

How does duration of required therapy vary by bacteria/antibiotic?
