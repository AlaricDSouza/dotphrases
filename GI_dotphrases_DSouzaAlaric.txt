.gicrohns
Crohn's patients have transmural inflammation with granuloma formation trhough a Th2 cytokine response. They often present with crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss and are at risk for fistulas, abscesses, and obstruction.

Diagnostics
General labs: CBC, Chem, iron studies
Inflammatory/autoimmune labs: ESR, CRP, Fecal calprotectin, Celiac testing, 
Infectious labs: SSYCE, Cdiff, Hepatitis panel (A, B, C)
Pre-treatment labs: TB testing [confirm TB negative before immune supression], Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) testing [check risk of bone marrow supression]
Imaging/Scoping: colonoscopy, endoscopy, MRI/CT

Treatments
Treatment for Crohn's disease focuses on anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids, aminosalicylates, and immune modulating antibodies.
- hydrocortisone, budesonide, prednisolone
- sulfasalazine, olsalazine, mesalazine (5-ASA), balsalazide
- infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab, vedolizumab,
ustekinumab


.giulcerativecolitis
Ulcerative colitis patients have mucosal and submucosal inflammation contiguously involving the rectum and colon through a Th17 response. They have crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and tenesmus and are at risk for hemorrhage and toxic megacolon.
PUCAI scoring is frequently used for determining severity and helping guide treatment in UC patients. It includes abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, number of stools in 24 hours, nocturnal stooling, and activity restriction with scores ranging from 0-85.

Diagnostics
General labs: CBC, Chem, iron studies
Inflammatory/autoimmune labs: ESR, CRP, Fecal calprotectin, Celiac testing, 
Infectious labs: SSYCE, Cdiff, Hepatitis panel (A, B, C)
Pre-treatment labs: TB testing [confirm TB negative before immune supression], Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) testing [check risk of bone marrow supression]
Imaging/Scoping: colonoscopy, endoscopy, MRI/CT

Treatments
Treatment for Ulcerative Colitis focuses on anti-inflammatory medications and enteral nutrition
- mesalazine (5-ASA), sulfasalazine, balsalazide, infliximab, azathioprine, mercaptopurine
- exclusive enteral nutrition
