.baclofentreatment

Goals:
- Improve spasticity
- Improve functional outcomes, such as gait capacity and postural ability in ambulating children with spasticity of cerebral origin
- Facilitate ease of care, comfort and quality of life
- Decrease pain and spasms associated with spasticity
- Improve sleep
- Prevent worsening of hip deformity
- Improve hygiene and ease of care, such as dressing, eating, positioning, transfers, dressing, toileting, and comfort
- Can decrease complications after spinal fusion
Mechanism: Inhibits post-synaptic GABA receptors and pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release
Side Effects: sedation, nausea, dizziness, hypotension, confusion, and weakness

.baclofenpumpsurgeryinfo
- Baclofen pump implantation (or replacement) is a neurosurgical procedure performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. The pump is implanted anteriorly in a pocket either subcutaneously (below the subcutaneous tissue and over the rectus abdominus fascia) or subfascially (below the rectus abdominus fascia). A catheter is thread subcutaneously from the pump to the intrathecal space, and advanced to the desired level, where the medication is delivered.
- Location:
-- C1-C4 for dystonia
-- T2-T7 for spastic quadraplegia
-- T10-T11 for spastic diplegia
- Post-op:
-- lie flat for 24 hours if new or replaced catheter
-- pain control for 24 hours
-- assess wound daily
-- IV antibiotic intraop and possibly post-op for 24 hours
-- confirm position with XR
Discharge Criteria (2-3 after surgery): pain controlled on enterals, tolerating feeds, voiding and stooling, XR confirming placement

Grade 0 - No increase in muscle tone.
Grade 1 - Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected parts are moved in flexion or extension.
Grade 1+ - Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion.
Grade 2 - More marked increase in muscle tone through most (more than half) of the range of motion, but affected part(s) easily moved.
Grade 3 - Considerable increase in muscle tone; passive movement is difficult.
Grade 4 - Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension.
Contracted (beyond grading)
